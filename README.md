## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-full
```

#### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S python python-pip python-venv
```

#### macOS

```bash
brew install python
```

#### Windows

- Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikohoffren/corhyn.git
   cd corhyn
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. Install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

Note: Always activate the virtual environment before working on the project. You'll know you're in the virtual environment when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

### Alternative Installation Using `install.sh`

For convenience, a shell script (`install.sh`) is provided in the root of the project. This script automates the setup process for Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) by:

1. Creating a virtual environment
2. Activating the virtual environment
3. Installing the package in development mode

To use the script, run:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Note:** This script is intended for Unix-like systems. Windows users should follow the manual installation instructions above.

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Where is my data stored?

All your tasks, tags, and time entries are stored in a local SQLite database at `~/.corhyn/tasks.db`.

### I updated the app and now I get a database error (e.g., missing column)

If you see errors about missing columns or tables after an update, your database schema may be out of date. You can reset the database by deleting the file at `~/.corhyn/tasks.db`. **Warning:** This will delete all your data.

### How do I reset all my data?

Delete the file at `~/.corhyn/tasks.db` and restart the CLI. A new, empty database will be created.

### I get an error about a missing command or option

Make sure you have the latest version of the code and have reinstalled the package with `pip install -e .` inside your virtual environment.

### How do I see all available commands?

Run `corhyn --help` to see all commands and options. You can also run `corhyn <command> --help` for details on a specific command.

### Can I use Corhyn on multiple devices?

Currently, Corhyn stores data locally and does not sync between devices. You can manually copy the `~/.corhyn/tasks.db` file if needed.

### How do I export my data?

Use `corhyn time --export <filename.csv>` to export your time tracking data. For tasks and tags, export is not yet implemented.
